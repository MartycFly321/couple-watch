## Terms of Service – CoupleWatch

Last updated: February 23, 2026

Welcome to CoupleWatch. By using the app, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Use of the App

The app is for personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to misuse the app or use it for unlawful purposes. CoupleWatch is designed for use between two consenting partners who mutually agree to share moods and moments with each other.

### 2. Your Content

You own your data — moods, moments, notes, and any other content you create. All data is stored in your personal iCloud account and shared with your partner through Apple's CloudKit. The developer does not access, process, or store your content on any external server.

### 3. Partner Connection

By inviting a partner or accepting an invite, you consent to sharing your moods and moments with that person through a shared iCloud zone. Either partner can disconnect at any time from Settings, which revokes access to the shared data.

### 4. Privacy

Your use of the app is subject to our Privacy Policy. CoupleWatch does not collect personal information, and does not send data to third-party services. All data remains in iCloud under your control.

### 5. iCloud Requirement

CoupleWatch requires an active iCloud account for core functionality including data storage, partner syncing, and widget data sharing. The app's availability and performance depend on Apple's iCloud services, which are governed by Apple's own terms and conditions.

### 6. Intellectual Property

All app features, designs, visuals, and code (excluding your personal content) are owned by the developer. You may not copy, modify, reverse-engineer, or distribute them.

### 7. Notifications

CoupleWatch may send local notifications when your partner shares a mood or moment. These are generated on-device and can be disabled at any time through your device's notification settings.

### 8. No Guarantees

The app is provided "as is." We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, real-time sync accuracy, or error-free functionality. Sync reliability depends on Apple's iCloud infrastructure and your network connection.

### 9. Termination

You can stop using CoupleWatch at any time by deleting the app. Disconnecting from a partner or deleting the app removes local data. iCloud data follows Apple's standard data retention policies.

### 10. Changes

We may update these Terms. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

### 11. Contact
