## Privacy Policy – CoupleWatch

Last updated: February 23, 2026

Your privacy is important to us. CoupleWatch is designed from the ground up to keep your data private — between you and your partner, and no one else.

This privacy policy explains what information is stored, where it lives, and what we do (and don't do) with it.

### About the App

CoupleWatch is a shared moment tracker for couples, built around a 24-hour dual-ring clock. Partners share moods, emoji moments, and love pokes — all synced privately through Apple's iCloud. This privacy policy applies to the app, the home screen widget, and any related services.

### Built in the Netherlands, with care

Created by an independent developer from the Netherlands, CoupleWatch is designed to help couples stay connected throughout their day — simply and privately.

### What Data Does CoupleWatch Store?

CoupleWatch stores only the data necessary to provide the shared experience between you and your partner. This includes:

- **Moods** — your mood entries (happiness and energy values, timestamps)
- **Moments** — emoji-based entries with optional notes and timestamps
- **Partner connection** — a shared iCloud zone linking you and your partner
- **Preferences** — ring colors, background color, notification settings, clock image (stored locally on your device)

### Where Is Your Data Stored?

All data is stored using Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) infrastructure. This means:

- Your data lives in your personal iCloud account
- Shared data between partners uses Apple's CloudKit sharing (CKShare)
- Preferences and settings are stored locally on your device via App Group storage
- **No data is sent to any third-party server**
- **No external databases or cloud services are used**

CoupleWatch does not operate its own servers. Apple's iCloud handles all storage, sync, and sharing.


### How Data Syncs Between Partners

When you connect with a partner:

1. One partner creates an invite link from Settings
2. The other partner accepts via the shared link
3. Apple's CloudKit creates a shared zone between both iCloud accounts
4. Moods and moments sync automatically through this shared zone

Only you and your accepted partner can access the shared data. The developer has no access to your iCloud data.

### Notifications

CoupleWatch uses **local notifications only**. When your partner creates a mood or moment, the app generates a notification on your device. No push notification servers are involved — notifications are triggered locally based on synced data.

### How Long Is Data Kept?

Your data persists as long as it exists in your iCloud account. Since all data is stored in iCloud:

- Deleting the app removes local data from your device
- iCloud data follows Apple's standard iCloud data retention
- You can delete individual moods and moments from within the app
- Disconnecting from a partner removes access to the shared zone

The developer has no ability to access, retain, or delete your data — it is entirely under your and Apple's control.

### Children's Privacy

CoupleWatch does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app does not require or collect any personal information.

### Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected here with an updated date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

### Questions or Concerns

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your data, contact the developer at: **martijnpublicdev@gmail.com**

### Responsible Entity

CoupleWatch is independently developed and not operated by a formal company at this time. The developer is committed to full GDPR compliance and user transparency.
